# macaque3Dpose 

<img src="./imgs/MovieS1.gif" width="800">ã€€  

This tool is designed to process multiple videos from various viewpoints and generate 3D pose estimations for groups of macaques. It is especially useful for analyzing the behavior of freely moving macaques in laboratory environments. The tool can be applied in areas such as biomedical, ethological, applied animal sciences and neuroscience research. 

- Analytic pipeline combining multiple CNNs and 3D reconstruction utilities. 
- Pretrained network optimized for 3D pose estimation of macaque groups. The pre-trained model outputs time series data of 3D positions for nose, ears, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, ankles. 
- The training dataset is available [here](XXX).
